The website about Veronika and Josef's wedding, contains basic information about their wedding and the possibility to leave a message to the newlyweds, a section for wedding guests, which can be accessed only by invited guests based on the verification code they enter during verification.
In the guest section, guests then fill out a basic wedding questionnaire with their requests, a wedding menu with a selection of food and drink (the selection is filtered based on the age of the guest and the request for vegetarian food), they can choose a wedding gift for the newlyweds from a selection of all gifts, and they can search and add songs to the wedding playlist, which is connected via API to Spotify.
The project includes all the supporting documentation, including CSV files from which data can be loaded into the database using scripts.
Technologies used: Django, API, CSS, JS.
